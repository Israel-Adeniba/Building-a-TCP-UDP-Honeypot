# Building a TCP/UDP Honeypot

## Objective
This project is a simple yet effective Honeypot designed to detect and log unauthorized access attempts on TCP and UDP ports. By simulating vulnerable services, this tool helps security analysts study attack patterns, identify malicious IPs, and improve network defenses
